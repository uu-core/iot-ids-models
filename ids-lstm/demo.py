# Suppose you have run two scenarios in the Cooja simulator successfully. Therefore in the two resulting folders the following files exist:

# - events.log:            it includes information about the time that the network entered the steady state, the attacker 
#                          node’s id, attacking time and the time that simulation finishes. All times are in microseconds. 
# - mote-output.log:       it is the most important file. It includes all information that we need to extract features, the UDP packets 
#                          that has been sent to the sink nodes by IoT nodes and the udp packets that has beenreceived by the sink node. 
# - script.log:            it includes the same information as events.log, but in more detail.
# - cooja.log 
# - radio-log.pcap
# - radio-medium.log



# OBSERVABLE PACKETS IN THE SINK NODE
# In the first step, extract the UDP messages that are observable to the sink node. 
# The following command, 
# 1 - extracts all the observable messages in the sink node
# 2 - calculates the mean and standard deviation of all observed messages in each 60 seconds (binSize) 
# 3 - save the resulting 14 features and corresponding labels in the features_timeseries_60_sec.csv file. The file is located in the same folder.
obs.MyDataSet(dataAdd = "/path/to/scenario/folder1/", binSize = 60)
obs.MyDataSet(dataAdd = "/path/to/scenario/folder2/", binSize = 60)
obs.MyDataSet(dataAdd = "/path/to/scenario/folder3/", binSize = 60)



# AGGREGATE
# To use the extracted data from both scenarios to train and test and IDS model, we need to aggregate data.
# NOTE: to aggregate data for the scenario in the paper, you can use available functions in the aggregate.py file.
# Here, as an example we use data from the 1st and the 2nd scenarios to train a model and data from the 3rd scenario to test that model:


trainDataList = []
testDataList = []

# training data
data1 = pd.read_csv("/path/to/scenario/folder1/features_timeseries_60_sec.csv", sep = ',')
data1 = data1.drop(['Unnamed: 0'],axis = 1)       # if there is a column for row numbers
trainDataList.append(data1)
data2 = pd.read_csv("/path/to/scenario/folder2/features_timeseries_60_sec.csv", sep = ',')
data2 = data2.drop(['Unnamed: 0'],axis = 1)       # if there is a column for row numbers
trainDataList.append(data2)
# testing data
data3 = pd.read_csv("/path/to/scenario/folder3/features_timeseries_60_sec.csv", sep = ',')
data3 = data3.drop(['Unnamed: 0'],axis = 1)       # if there is a column for row numbers
testDataList.append(data3)





# MIN MAX NORMALIZATION
# The train data constitiutes of two scenarios. Therefore in each scnario there are a min and a max for each feature. 
# To normalize the train data we find the global min and max and then normalize the data with reapect to them.

#### normalize train data
# find the list of features MINs and MAXs for all scenarios
min_max_list = [(df.min().to_frame(name='Min').T, df.max().to_frame(name='Max').T) for df in trainDataList]

# Separate lists to store min and max DataFrames
min_dfs = [min_df for min_df, max_df in min_max_list]
max_dfs = [max_df for min_df, max_df in min_max_list]

# Concatenate all min and max DataFrames into one DataFrame each
base_all_mins_df = pd.concat(min_dfs, ignore_index=True)
base_all_maxs_df = pd.concat(max_dfs, ignore_index=True)

global_max = base_all_maxs_df.max(axis = 0)
global_min = base_all_mins_df.min(axis = 0)
   
normalized_train = [df.apply(lambda x: (x - global_min[x.name]) / (global_max[x.name] - global_min[x.name])) for df in trainDataList]



##### normmalize test data based on the global_min and global_max found in the train data
normalized_test = [df.apply(lambda x: (x - global_min[x.name]) / (global_max[x.name] - global_min[x.name])) for df in testDataList]



# SEQUENCES AS INPUT TO THE LSTM MODEL
# To use a LSTM model we have to decide about the sequence length of input data. As we have two groups of timeseries 
# (each Cooja's scenario generates a 14 timeseries data), we can not easily use the sequence length hyperparameter in 
# the LSTM model. Therefore, in this step we generate the sequences and save them in 
# each scenario's folder and then we set the sequence length hyperparameter in the LSTM model as 1. To generate these 
# sequences use seqMaker.py. In our paper we used sequence_length = 10 (10 minutes) as the input.
